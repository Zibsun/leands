# Acknowledgements

First of all, I’m immensely grateful to the Lean Data Science Team: Alexey Mogilnikov and Yuliya Rubtsova. You are co-authors of the LeanDS approach, and you constantly develop and improve it. Without your knowledge, ideas, energy, and passion, this book would not be possible.

Also, my special thanks to Evgeniy Shevchuk, for helping me translate this book into English and for his feedback.

This book wouldn’t have been possible without the corporate organizations that allowed me to develop and test ideas in projects, workshops, and consulting engagements.

I’m also grateful to the Lean Data Science Community, always eager to test new ideas, new ways of thinking, and new practices, which has allowed me to use the group as a learning laboratory. I could not have done this without your help and constructive critique.
