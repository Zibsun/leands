# What is Lean DS

Lean Data Science is an open-ended approach to DS projects and product management. It is:

* Business-oriented
* Hypothesis-driven
* Collaborative and iterative
* Rigorous and reproducible

It brings process transparency, cuts time-to-market, helps to focus on engineering excellence, and consequently increases the chances of success.

LeanDS is business-oriented. We discuss the cost-efficiency of ML projects and focus on speeding them up. However, some of these tools fit science and pet projects well, too.

The LeanDS cornerstone is clean and precise hypothesis formulation.

LeanDS relies on teamwork. Its job approach is iterative and incremental and focuses on delivering the most valuable results in as little time as possible.

Finally, it is sequential and easy to reproduce. Code excellence and testing and delivery automation are crucial for a positive business outcome.

## The Book Structure

We will cover the practices improving each stage of the ML product lifecycle â€” from idea to production.

We will design a new ML project, starting with a software project vision: AI Canvas. An ML product may be part of a vital product. We will discuss how to consider that in the Story Map chapter.

We will examine how to use product hypotheses to describe team members' tasks and prioritize them and how to use the "Mercedes" approach to schedule the implementation of those hypotheses.

In the last chapters, we will discuss a team structure and examine the use of Kanban for DS projects.
