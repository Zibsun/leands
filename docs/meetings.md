## Kanban Meetings

## Stand-Up Meeting, aka Kanban-Meeting

Stand-up is a daily meeting near the team board. Its rules:

* Participants are a team + external experts if necessary.
* Stand-up takes place daily, at the same time.
* The team passes along all board tickets from right to left.
* The host asks, «What is the obstacle to advancing this work further?» for each of the tickets.
* Each blocker gets a person in charge and a deadline.
* The focus is accelerating tasks advancement along the board.
* The team first focuses on the older tasks.

Try to do the stand-up in 15 minutes. It seems like a difficult task. Over time, you will learn to make it even faster:

* You might start discussing every ticket, gradually narrowing the focus to blockers only as your team experience grows.
* The team learns to work with a board outside the stand-up, identifying blockers, tagging statuses in comments, breaking down work into tasks, etc.
* The team interacts with each other ad-hoc, continuously, using stand-up for additional synchronization.
* At stand-up, the team members learn to only share what is essential.
* All necessary joint discussions happen outside of stand-up.

## Planning, aka Replenishment Meeting

These are the planning meeting rules:

* Members are a team, stakeholders, and external experts.
* Members select the most critical backlog items and place them in the Hot Queue.
* The number of its slots limits a tickets number the Hot Queue can accommodate. The picture shows the Hot Queue with WIP=7 and four hypotheses in place, leaving only three spaces available.

## Retrospection, aka Performance Review

Regularly (usually once every two weeks or once a month), the team gathers for 1-1.5 hours for the performance review.

The retrospection has the main rule (Prime Directive) that Norman Kurt introduced:

!> No matter what we discover, we understand and firmly believe that we have done our best in the time, skills, capabilities, and resources, given the circumstances.

Should it turn into a flood of recriminations, the meeting productivity will be close to zero. We're discussing how to change the system to fix the problems we found.

Here are some rules of retrospection:

* Retrospection is about the process efficiency rather than the final product.
* Retrospection results in work being done differently. The difference can be a new or removed board column(s), WIP restrictions, Explicit Policies, or additional board rules.
* Retrospective solutions are experimental. We agree to alter the approach and discuss its efficiency in subsequent retrospections.

## Retrospective formats

There are many possible formats. The most convenient and straightforward is the following. Break the board into four parts:

* Pros. What worked and what we want to keep in the process.
* Cons. What didn’t work (posed risks, affected performance, etc.)
* Ideas. What can we improve to solve these issues?
* Plan. What will we change in the process?

Then:

* The host reads the results of the last retrospective aloud.
* Participants move through all the four quadrants on the board, placing the sticky notes with ideas.

Therefore, the team gets a set of changes designed to improve the process.
