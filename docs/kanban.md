# About Kanban

In this book, we can only present the minimal necessary description of the Kanban method. For more details, please consult the specialized literature. The Kanban method design lets you manage all types of professional services. Below, we will consider it exclusively in application to DS projects and products.

Kanban includes three following principles (calls to action):

* Sustainability. Often, in our work, we see a problem. And we put all our energy into it. Then a new situation emerges, and we jump, leaving the first issue behind. Kanban proposes to adjust the work process so that it becomes stable and balanced.
* Service orientation. Focus on maximizing customer satisfaction.
* Survivability. Whatever changes are ahead, we must be able to rebuild our work quickly.

## Practices of Kanban

Kanban consists of 6 practices:

* Visualization
* Limit Work in Progress
* Manage Flow
* Explicit policies
* Feedback
* Continuous, incremental changes in search of improvements

Next, we will see how to apply them to ML products.
