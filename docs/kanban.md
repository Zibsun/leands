# About Kanban

In this book, we can only present the minimal necessary description of the Kanban method. For more details, please consult the specialized literature. The Kanban method design lets you manage all types of professional services. Below, we will consider it exclusively in application to DS projects and products.

Kanban includes three following agendas:

* The Sustainability Agenda is about finding a sustainable pace and improving focus. Often, in our work, we see a problem. And we put all our energy into it. Then a new situation emerges, and we jump, leaving the first issue behind. Kanban proposes to adjust the work process so that it becomes stable and balanced.
* The Service Orientation Agenda focuses attention on performance and customer satisfaction.
* The Survivability Agenda is concerned with staying competitive and adaptive.

## Practices of Kanban

Kanban consists of 6 practices:

* Visualization
* Limit Work in Progress
* Manage Flow
* Make Policies Explicit
* Implement Feedback Loops
* Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally

Next, we will see how to apply them to ML products.
