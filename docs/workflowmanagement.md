# Workflow Management

One of the key ideas in Kanban is managing work, not people.

Instead of constantly throwing all our strength and people into the next problem, we constantly fine-tune workflow management system.

We design the Kanban board, helping the team members to self-organize around workflow. We aim to ensure flow stability, decrease Lead Time and improve total Throughput.

The team itself monitors the process and suggests improvements keeping the whole process transparent and visual. To ensure that, the team:

* Configures columns
* Set and change WIP limits
* Creates and updates Explicit Policies

There are several metrics and diagrams to evaluate these improvements.  

Quantitative flow control is an exciting and vast topic. So, we will only look at two examples.

## Lead Time Distribution

This diagram allows estimating Lead Time, an average time required by one ticket of a specific type. The X-axis represents the Lead Time, and the Y-axis represents the corresponding tickets number. You may want to consider the Lead Time median and its 85% percentile. The team's goal is to bring Lead Time down to the target level.

## Throughput Diagram

Bandwidth is the second important metric. It shows the team's amount of work done per unit (for instance, in a month). To get insights, compare Throughput with Demand )which is the number of new tickets in the backlog). If the Throughput is significantly lower than the Demand, think about expanding the team.
