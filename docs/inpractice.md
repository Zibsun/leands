# Applying Lean Data Science

Well done! You have almost finished this book! We have reviewed the essential DS management practices.

I hope you are excited to try LeanDS with your team =). In conclusion, I want to make a few remarks about practical use and implementation.

Do you have to use all LeanDS practices?

Of course not! Some practices may be irrelevant in your situation. For example, the business may choose not to prioritize for any particular reason; that is also normal.

## Implementation

* Implementing all practices at once is risky. Start with the one you need most. Try it, adapt to your case and environment, and make sure it works. Then take on the next.
* Where to start? There's no good answer to this question. Start with the most straightforward and valuable practices, in your opinion.
* All the practices in this book are just a starting point. You will undoubtedly refine and further develop them.
* Try to make decisions to change the process openly, discussing them together as a team.
