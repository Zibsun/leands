# Applying Lean Data Science

Well done! You have almost finished this book! We have reviewed the main Data Science project and product management practices.

I hope you are excited to try LeanDS with your team =). In conclusion, I want to make a few remarks about its practical use and implementation.

Do you have to use all LeanDS practices?

Of course not! Some practices may be irrelevant in your situation. For example, the business may choose not to prioritize; that is also normal.

## Implementation

* It is best to put these practices into work sequentially. Try the first, and make sure it works. Then take on the next.
* Where to start? With the most straightforward and valuable practices, in your opinion.
* Most of the practices in this book are simplified. You will undoubtedly refine and further develop them.
* Try to make decisions to change the process openly, discussing them together as a team.
