# Lean DS Community

The Lean Data Science community has existed since 2019. It develops flexible approaches to DS project and product management.

The community goal is to create the approaches to build efficient and continuously self-improving delivery processes for high-quality DS products.

At Lean DS, we collect best practices for DS project and product management, forge them into methodologies, and help implement them across all industries around the globe.

## Best Practices

To study and generalize world management experience in DS, we:

* Interview leaders of organizations with established practices and proven efficiency.
* Organize expert meet-ups to discuss and solve typical industry problems.
* Explore the applicability of approaches from related areas, such as Software Engineering and Product Management.

## How We Create Our Approaches

* Organize meetings where industry experts brainstorm and crystallize the best practices into concrete tools and methods.
* Consult with industry experts, extracting the details and nuances of different approaches.
* Pilot with real teams, collect feedback, correct errors, and complement new ideas.

## Popularization

* We offer training, masterclasses, and meet-ups for organizations and individuals to educate and discuss Lean DS methods and their implementation.
