## What is LeanDS

!> LeanDS is a Process Framework for managing Machine Learning products and projects.

The term "framework" means that LeanDS cannot be "implemented" from point to point, but it can be the foundation for your process.

LeanDS is a set of practices. Most of these are a compilation of mature teams' well-established processes. We have done a thorough job of testing these practices in our consulting work.

LeanDS practices have been simplified so that any team can use them. The practices are thus the starting point for building your mature process.

None of these practices are required, and none of them guarantee success. However, using these practices along with a good deal of common sense should increase the likelihood of success. We call it the LeanDS hypothesis, and dozens of teams empirically tested it.

Please try, experiment and adapt all of these practices to your situation!
