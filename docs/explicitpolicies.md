# Explicit Policies

You identify the problem in your way of work. You develop a rule that facilitates solving it or at least minimizing the risk. For example, you decide to specify dependencies on external teams at the hypothesis analysis stage. That allows foreseeing the blockers and dealing with them in advance.

You can write such a rule as an Explicit Policy. It is a checklist answering the question: «Can we move the ticket to the next column?»
